The university also has the Student Mental Health Policy. The policy sates the University\'s commitment to provideing a supportive envrionment for the holistic development of students, includeing the improvement of mental health and wellbeing. These policies and codes concering students can be found in the following link. <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/SAO/Pages/Policies-concerning-students.aspx">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/SAO/Pages/Policies-concerning-students.aspx</a>'),
('Academic Integrity', 'Good academic work depends on honesty and ethical behavior. The quality of your work as a student relies on adhering to the principles of academic integrity and to the NTU Honor Code, a set of values shared by the whole university community. Truth, Trust and Justice are at the core of NTU\'s shared values.
As a student, it is important that you reconize your responsibilities in understanding and applying the principles of acadmeic integrity in all the work you do at NTU. Not knowing what is involved in maintaining academic integrity does not excuse academic dishonesty. You need to actively equip yourself with strategies to avoid all forms of academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, academic fraud, and collusion and cheating. If you are uncertain of the definitions of any of these terms, you should go to the academic integrity website for more information. Consult your instructor(s) if you need any clarificiation about the requirements of academic integrity in the course.')
